Gift her a cozy spa evening set. Aromatic candles, facial masks, bath salts, and massage oils will help her unwind and enjoy some self-care.

Support her hobbies by giving a masterclass course. Whether it's a cooking class, painting lessons, or even dance classes – the choice depends on her interests.
