You have been invited to the home of your close ones or friends, and you don't know what to bring to the festive table? No problem! In this article, we will explore various gift options and surprises, as well as tips for selecting treats.

Often, when we go to someone's house, we don't know what to give the hosts. Some immediately know what to bring – it could be dishes, good alcohol, or homemade snacks. But these choices are often cliché. After all, you want to surprise people by giving them pleasant emotions!

Festive dinners and parties are the perfect time for exchanging gifts and showing care to the hosts. However, choosing the right gift can be a challenging task.

### Factors to Consider When Choosing Gifts:

- **Do the hosts drink alcohol:** Perhaps, you are visiting for the first time and don't have this information. To avoid any awkward situations, find out if it would be appropriate to give good whiskey or collectible wine.

- **Interior of the house:** If you've decided to gift a decorative figurine or painting, you should understand that it should appeal to the hosts. Your taste should align with the preferences of your friends if you want it to genuinely please them.

- **Taste preferences:** If you decide to bring a snack or a dish prepared by you, you should know if there are any allergies to the components of that dish and whether the hosts like a particular product.

- **Context of the celebration:** Consider the character and theme of the event. For example, different gifts would be suitable for a New Year's Eve than for a birthday or an Easter dinner. Flowers might be appropriate for a birthday, while unusual pastries and snacks might be suitable for an Easter meal.

- **Number of guests:** This is also a crucial factor when choosing a gift. If the celebration gathers a large number of guests, the gift may need to be versatile or supplemented with several copies. If there are children in the house, it's advisable to pay attention to them too.

### What Not to Give or Bring as Gifts?

- Once you've decided on the gift, it's worth checking if it falls into the category of items not recommended to bring as gifts. For instance, kitchenware, especially knives, is often on that list.

- **Personal gifts:** Any surprises related to personal or intimate themes can cause confusion, which, in turn, can spoil relationships.

- **Inappropriate items:** This includes noisy toys for children. They can disrupt the atmosphere and interfere with a good time.

- **Gifts that can cause allergies:** This applies not only to foods but also to flowers and animals. Some may be accustomed to giving surprise kittens or puppies (for example, for a housewarming). Such a "surprise" may be entirely inappropriate, as your friends may not be ready for it.

By excluding these gift categories from your choices, you can give something appropriate, pleasant, and thoughtfully selected, enhancing the festive atmosphere and bringing joy to the hosts.

If you are going to someone's house, it's essential to inquire about the hosts' preferences in advance – sometimes it's better to ask beforehand, as people may already have a list of what they need. In America and Europe, this trend is called a "wish list," where people gather all the necessary items in a smartphone app or simply write a list, and friends and invited people choose what to give at their discretion. This has become popular for a long time and is already deeply ingrained in our culture. Typically, gifts on such a "wish list" have different price policies, allowing each invitee to feel comfortable.
