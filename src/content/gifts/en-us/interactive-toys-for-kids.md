Toys come in such a variety that adults sometimes find it difficult to navigate the vast assortment. Today, the most popular among them are board games, soft toys, and children's developmental books. But children show special love and interest in interactive toys.

## Why Interactive Toys Are So Popular

Toys often become real friends to children. Of course, they cannot replace live communication with peers, but they can bring variety to a child's playtime. This is the reason for the popularity of interactive toys. Interactive toys offer new entertainments every day. Modern parents don't have many opportunities to dedicate as much time to their children as they would like. Daycares or beloved nannies can partly solve this problem, but children are active and sociable, and they also like to take care of someone and show attention. This is where interactive toys come in handy. Funny, and sometimes even funny, they play with children. Kids take care of them, "feed" them, take them for a walk, or simply hug them. Along with interactive toys, children can learn songs, poems, numbers, and letters. Manufacturers have programmed cute bunnies, monkeys, rabbits, bears, and mice to interact with children. By giving your child such a present, you will give them a new friend who will accompany them in all their entertainment and learning.

## Types of Interactive Toys

The most popular interactive toys are figurines of domestic, wild, and mythical animals. Every child wants to have a favorite pet to take care of. All toys of this type can move and talk, repeat certain words and sounds after their owner. The number of additional functions always depends on the features and type of interactive toy. Interactive animal figurines teach children to show affection and care, responsibility, and discipline. This means they are not just a fun game but also contribute to the development of personality and the nurturing of important human feelings. A bright example is the popular character Furby – it sings, dances, and even snores in its sleep. It remembers the words spoken by the child and repeats them. It needs to be fed and taken for a walk. This is even better and more interesting than the famous Tamagotchi. If you cannot afford to have a pet for your child or you think your child cannot handle taking care of a living creature, such interactive toys will be an ideal gift.

All interactive toys are made of environmentally friendly and safe materials. They do not have elements or details that can injure a child or have a toxic effect on their health. Typically, children under 5 years old are particularly interested in such toys. At this age, children already have their own passions in games and entertainment, so let them choose their own "friend" – an interactive toy. However, it is also worth noting that even children under 10 years old may be interested in interactive toys. It all depends on the child's character.

## Varieties of Interactive Toys

There are no strict canons regarding the form, size, or set of functions for such toys – the assortment on the market is wide and diverse.

When choosing such a gift, you can focus on satisfying the child's needs at a certain age for their development. For example, choose toys that specifically teach the alphabet, counting, a foreign language, fine motor skills, or memory. It is noteworthy that the entire learning process happens imperceptibly for the child because everything looks like an exciting game to them. And since all children always enjoy items that make sounds and have light effects, such modern amusements will certainly delight them.

There is no strict classification for them either, but they can be roughly divided into: animals and birds (cats, dogs, rabbits, parrots, ponies and horses, unicorns, dragons, and dinosaurs, tigers and monkeys, and even fish.), robots, drones, dolls and puppets, musical instruments, as well as various books and pens, alphabets, maps, posters, and much more. In short, you have a huge choice!

Give your attention and care to your child by showing your imagination in choosing a toy; it will definitely please them because it's not just another construction set or teddy bear.
