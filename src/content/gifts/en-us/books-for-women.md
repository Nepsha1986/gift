# If your beloved is passionate about reading...

If your beloved is passionate about reading, always carrying a bestseller in her bag, reading a volume of her favorite novel during leisure or travel, or regularly adding professional literature to her library, then our gift ideas will surely come in handy. The world of literature is so diverse that it might be challenging for you to choose that perfect book that will not only bring pleasure but also provide value. To assist you in your selection, we suggest exploring our curated list.

## Top 5 Books in Different Genres

### Fiction
The best choice for a girl who is into novels, enjoys intriguing plotlines, has a vivid imagination, and immerses herself in the history of characters more eagerly than during a movie. Our recommendation for such a lady is the novel "The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini.

### Detective Stories
Suitable for a curious girl who loves solving puzzles and intricate stories. You can choose traditional classics like Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express" or something more modern, such as Robert Galbraith's "The Cuckoo's Calling."

### Biographies
Ideal for women who are not just passionate about literature but are also interested in historical figures, celebrities, their life journeys, and contributions to the world. This type of literature may seem dull to some, so it's essential to choose it knowing exactly whose life story the girl would find interesting. From recent releases, we recommend "The Woman with a Plan" by Maye Musk or "Friends, Lovers, and a Big Failure" by Matthew Perry. There are also many books about historical figures, such as biographies of Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher. Literature about the rise of renowned designers and fashion icons is also available, suitable for girls passionate about fashion.

### Professional Literature
Choose based on your girl's or wife's field of expertise. If she is interested in changing her profession, you can select an excellent book for beginners in various fields. While subjects like marketing, economics, law, or psychology are better studied through courses, a book covering an essential topic or a new approach can be an excellent gift to understand it better. In this case, we recommend paying attention to all books by Philip Kotler and Gavin Kennedy, especially "Getting to Yes."

### Motivational Reads
One of the most popular genres in recent years. Books on self-awareness and self-improvement have taken over the world and will undoubtedly appeal to every girl, bringing significant benefits as well. Our recommendation is Greg McKeown's "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" and Daniel Goleman's "Emotional Intelligence."

If you are still uncertain about which book to gift, we recommend purchasing a gift certificate from a bookstore. This way, your girl can choose something she will find interesting to read.
