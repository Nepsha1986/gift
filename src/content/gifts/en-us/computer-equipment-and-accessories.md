If you're unsure what could delight a teenager besides fashionable clothing and accessories, a brand-new smartphone, or tablet, we recommend turning your attention to computer hardware. This category includes desktop PCs, laptops, and all-in-one computers. Since nowadays not only handheld gadgets are popular, purchasing desktop technology can be a useful and needed gift for the upcoming generation.

## Things to Consider When Choosing Computer Hardware

Progress is moving forward, but there are still teenagers who would never trade their personal computer for a tablet. Firstly, because it aids in studying, and secondly, many teenagers who are into gaming still prefer desktop computers. You might think, what kind of gift is a computer, just a toy, but it's not quite so. A traditional PC can serve as both a study tool and a gaming option (provided it's powerful, with high performance levels, and ample memory). By the way, these parameters should also be considered when choosing.

The market offers a fantastic range of modern computer hardware designed for various functions. If you're unsure whether to gift a tablet to a teenager because it's compact and portable, or a good and modern computer, we've compiled a list of PC advantages:

- Configuration allowing parts placement to minimize space and maximize safety;
- Devices not subjected to constant transportation are less prone to mechanical damage.

But not only PCs can be considered as gifts. As we've mentioned, computer hardware includes laptops and all-in-one computers too. In favor of gifting a laptop, we can say that it's mobile, it can be set up almost anywhere for convenient gaming or studying. Moreover, it's not tied to a specific location where a power outlet is available for connection.

Regarding all-in-one computers, they're also a good gift and an excellent alternative to a regular PC. Essentially, all-in-one computers and desktops perform the same functions and look alike, except the former doesn't have a bulky system unit.
