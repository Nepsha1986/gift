Delight a teenager with the opportunity to attend an exciting event they've long dreamed of and experience a multitude of positive emotions and impressions!

If you're wondering how else to please the younger generation besides a brand new gadget, we have an answer for you. Of course, something creative, unusual, exciting, and memorable! Giving experiences and emotions is much more enjoyable than even the most desired item! So, we suggest considering a gift like a ticket to a coveted show, concert, or sporting event.

## What Ticket to Give?

Any event is not just a way to see an artist or a long-awaited performance, to sing a favorite song, or to meet with friends. These are emotions that can inspire and fill with positivity for many days afterwards. If you want to give emotions, not clothes, a phone, or a console — a gift ticket will be your best solution!
You have two options for which ticket to buy:
- a gift electronic ticket;
- a standard ticket to a pre-selected event.

**Gift electronic ticket** is a special online certificate through which you can choose any event as a gift. Just imagine, you don't have to go to the box office of a concert hall, stadium, or even search the website of a theater or exhibition for a suitable play or time. Just choose a gift ticket online. 
You buy a ticket to any event, and the teenager then exchanges it for entry to a concert, show, or exhibition that they like. That is, such a ticket is not tied to dates and a specific show, but allows them to choose it independently based on the purchase value. This method is very convenient and is more suitable as a gift if you don't know the teenager very well. 

The second option can be considered if you are close to the teenager, for example, best friends or relatives, and you know exactly which event or show will bring them maximum pleasure and be memorable for life.

## Where to Buy Tickets?

We've figured out what ticket to give, and now let's find out what events you can choose as a gift if you want to present not just a certificate, but a ticket to a specific event. We've compiled a list of the best shows or other activities that may be interesting to a teenager:

- large-scale concerts (for example, in large concert halls or stadiums. It should be a performance by a world-class star or favorite artist);
- various festivals (suitable as a gift if someone will accompany the teenager);
- stand-up shows;
- theatrical performances;
- eternal classics – a concert by a symphony orchestra, chamber concert, opera, or ballet;
- cozy house parties (for example, thematic ones like singing to a guitar or dancing to Latin rhythms);
- poetic evenings;
- art and photo exhibitions;
- fashion shows;
- sports events (football and other themes);
- circus performances; 
- ice theatrical shows;
- sessions at the planetarium;
- educational exhibitions in museums, etc. 

In this list, we have included the most popular opportunities to get a lot of positive emotions and impressions. At the same time, we want to highlight several non-standard solutions for a gift ticket, but quite relevant for modern teenagers:

- **Movie Theater Tickets**. This can be either a symbolic gift for one VIP seat or a gift certificate for six months or a year.
- **Webinar Tickets**. Webinars by well-known and respected speakers among teenagers are a very popular topic today, but admission to them is usually paid. You can pay for a webinar for the teenager as a gift.
- **Seminars and Training**. These are face-to-face events that, like webinars, can be enjoyable and useful for teenagers. Find out which events the speakers they like will be holding and give them an entry ticket. They usually last 1-2 days and are held on weekends, so most likely attending a seminar or training will not affect the school process. This option is more suitable for older school-age children.

And finally, no matter what ticket you plan to give to a teenage girl or boy, the main thing is that it is appropriate. A gift is especially valuable if it brings benefit or positive impressions.
