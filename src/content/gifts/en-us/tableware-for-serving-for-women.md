Good quality tableware is the dream of many women. The ritual of dining involves not only delicious food but also elegant tableware, utensils, and other accessories. Tableware has always been considered a great gift, especially for a homemaker. After all, a beautifully set table is a symbol of a woman's good taste and a life of abundance.

Quality tableware items become more expensive with each passing year, gradually transitioning into the realm of antiques. To help you choose something truly worthwhile, we have compiled a **list of suitable tableware gifts**.

## Set of Dinner Plates

In this case, the choice largely depends on the woman's taste. Therefore, focus on the style of the existing tableware in the house. A universal option is simple white plates, either glossy or matte. The main condition is the absence of patterns, embossing, or engravings. They don't necessarily have to be round either. Use your imagination and gift square plates or more exotic shapes.

## Tea Set

A beautiful porcelain tea set for several people is the perfect gift for a refined and elegant lady. Surely, she enjoys entertaining guests and serving dessert and tea in beautiful cups and saucers. Consider choosing a set with Chinese or Japanese motifs or elements of luxury, such as gold detailing and intricate ornaments. Handmade tea sets are particularly valuable.

## Dining Set

This is beautiful tableware for everyday meals. Plates, salad dishes, and soup bowls can be made of durable glass suitable for heating food in the microwave. A versatile gift is a set for 4 people, combining black and white colors without patterns. Such dining sets can be found from the popular brand Luminarc. If you want to surprise your lady, consider Italian tableware with a "lemon" print.

## Breakfast Set

A breakfast set is beautiful tableware that will brighten even a gloomy morning, making the dining process more enjoyable and giving your woman a good mood for the day. In such a set, there may be a coffee or tea cup and a bowl for dry breakfasts or a bowl for healthy food. It's better if the cup and bowl are made of sturdy, borosilicate, and heat-resistant glass capable of withstanding temperatures from -40° to +220° degrees. The outer walls should not heat up, making it impossible to burn oneself. Additionally, the double-walled design of the tableware allows drinks and food to stay warm for up to 2 hours. As for the volume of the cup and bowl, 300 or 500 ml are considered the most convenient.

The process of choosing such a gift is no less responsible than selecting jewelry. Details, color scheme, the presence or absence of ornaments, and intricate patterns are all important in tableware. Moreover, it's good if the tableware you choose as a gift fits the style of the kitchen or living room.
