In the modern digital world, the most popular gifts are usually gadgets that simplify life or serve for entertainment. However, playing musical instruments is a much more interesting and profound activity. In some cases, such a way of entertainment is highly sought after for experiencing aesthetic pleasure. Music delights the ear, inspires, and uplifts. To achieve these goals, it is not enough to simply have skill as a musician or a desire to learn – it is necessary to choose a worthy instrument. Of course, when choosing such a gift, you should be certain that the teenager is passionate about music and that it will bring them maximum benefit.

## Choosing Musical Instruments as Gifts

The choice depends on the type of music the teenager is already engaged in or wants to learn. These can be percussion, wind, string, electric, acoustic, ethnic, traditional musical instruments from any group. Of course, the choice is vast, but it narrows down when you know the teenager's preferences. Therefore, if you are not a parent, it is very important to know as much information as possible.

When choosing, it is also important to find the perfect balance between the cost and quality of the musical instrument. To do this, in addition to trusting a well-known brand or user reviews, you need to consider such aspects as:

- Sound clarity.
- Quality of construction.
- Materials of manufacture.
- Integrity of construction.
- Instrument's condition.
- Ease of use.
- Design solutions (appearance).

We have compiled a selection of musical instruments that are most often given to teenagers, including: classical and acoustic guitars, electric guitars, digital pianos and synthesizers, as well as electronic drums. For ease of selection, we have focused on certain criteria and provided basic recommendations. All this is to provide you with comprehensive information on which type of instrument is ideal for different types of learning, namely:

- for lessons at a music school;
- private lessons or self-study;
- home music-making.

### Classical Guitar

A classical guitar, also known as a Spanish guitar, is a type of acoustic guitar with nylon strings, an hourglass-shaped body, and a wide neck. Only this type of instrument would be suitable for a teenager for music school lessons.

### Acoustic Guitar

An acoustic guitar is exactly what is needed if a teenager loves to sing songs with accompaniment, play rock, pop, and all modern music. "Acoustics" always have metal strings, making their sound bright and loud. An ideal gift for a musically advanced teenager.

### Electric Guitar

An electric guitar is the most "individualized" musical instrument available, with various form factors, types of pickups, and even the number of strings ranging from 6 to 9. Therefore, when choosing such a gift, it is better to consider the music styles it will be used for, as there are many technical parameters that are difficult for a non-professional to navigate.

### Digital Piano

If a teenager decides to master the keyboard, that's great! But first, it is necessary to determine what exactly they will be playing, where they will be studying, and, as a result, which type of instrument is suitable for these tasks. In short and clear terms: for Chopin's etudes, Mozart, and studying at a music school – a digital piano would be suitable, and if they will play with accompaniment and sing hits by Queen or any other modern music, then a synthesizer. This instrument has a good set of high-quality timbres and is ideal for both learning and rehearsing and performing with a group. A synthesizer cannot replace a piano in a music school, but it will be an excellent additional instrument for music lessons.

### Electronic Drum Kits

If a teenager plays the drums or plans to learn, an excellent gift would be an electronic drum kit that can be set up at home. Modern manufacturers have come up with quiet electronic drum kits, which means that neighbors and relatives will not suffer, and the teenager will be able to learn and record material in comfortable conditions at home and at any convenient time. Also, when choosing, it is important to consider the teenager's skill level. Drum kits are available on the market for both beginner musicians and advanced ones.

These musical instruments are the most popular and versatile gifts and will appeal to any teenager planning to pursue music.
