Are books for teenagers still relevant? Absolutely! Not everyone enjoys playing computer games or reading literature from the school curriculum. Moreover, many think that teenagers are not interested in reading at all, that's the modern youth for you. But that's not the case, because otherwise there wouldn't be so many books on the market aimed specifically at 12-16 year olds.

Young adult literature, or as it's fashionably called today â€” young adult books, is currently experiencing its heyday. There are so many interesting books for teenagers appearing on the shelves of bookstores that adults wouldn't mind reading as well. And it's all because teenagers are no longer perceived as "people who haven't grown up yet," and it's no longer enough for them to read books about how to listen to parents, be polite, or informative encyclopedias.

If you want to give a teenager a truly valuable gift in the form of a modern, interesting, and captivating book, we've compiled a list that has what you need for almost grown boys and girls!

## How to Choose a Book from the List?

Teenagers are usually not very interested in lyrical fiction or the familiar classics, so many authors in their books try to address difficult and deep questions, delve into social and psychological themes, as well as into the development and self-discovery of a teenager. And it's very good that such books are appearing on the shelves, as this speaks to the qualitative development of modern literature for the formation of the personality of the younger generation.

Before we move on to the list of the most popular books for modern teenagers, we would like to give you some important tips on choosing such a gift:

- **Age restrictions**. There are works that will suit both 12-year-olds and those who are already 16. When choosing, pay attention to the age category the book is aimed at. After all, if it doesn't match the age, it probably won't arouse much interest.
- **Gender of the teenager**. There are many books on the market that will definitely suit only girls or only boys. Teen literature for boys and girls may be accordingly marked on the cover, so pay attention to this detail. Of course, girls will be more interested in reading about love, something romantic, while boys will enjoy literature about strong friendship, adventures, fantasy.
- **Description of the book and plot**. All teenagers are different, and perhaps someone at 14 is ready to read a book aimed at 16-year-olds. Also, if a literary work is aimed at 12-13 year olds, it doesn't mean that it's not suitable for older teenagers. The main advice when choosing is to carefully read the description of the book's plot, and only then decide if the book you liked is suitable for the teenager you want to give it to. And also, pay attention to whether you want to read the book you want to give. It's important.

## Top 10 Books to Give a Teenager:

1. "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" by J.K. Rowling;
2. "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee;
3. "The Whole World" by Nicola Yoon;
4. "Just Like You" by Mark Levy;
5. "Northern Lights" by Philip Pullman;
6. "The Ruby Circle" by Richelle Mead;
7. "The Matilda Effect" by Ellie Irving;
8. "Here in the Real World" by Sara Pennypacker;
9. "The Secret Garden" by Frances Hodgson Burnett;
10. "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury.

Special attention deserves books on personal development, self-discovery, the cultivation of necessary skills, especially those related to communication and relationships with parents. This is a kind of socio-psychological literature that will be of interest not to every teenager. Rather, to those who already at this age are developing leadership qualities and have a special interest in personality psychology.

In this case, we recommend paying attention to books such as:

1. "Go where it's scary and you'll have what you dream of" by Jim Lovelace.
2. "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens" by Stephen Covey.
3. "How to Talk to Anyone" by Mark Rhodes.
4. "The Day That Taught Me to Live" by Lauren Gunnel.
5. "Dream, Plan, Achieve" or Self-Development Training for Teenagers.

Choose books as a gift for the younger generation that will bring maximum benefit, that you'll want to tell your friends about and reread several times. The best book gift from you is the one that will awaken the desire to read even more.
