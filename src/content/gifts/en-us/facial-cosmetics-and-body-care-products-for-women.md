## List of Top Products

- **Body lotion**: Choose one from the vast variety that suits her specific skin type or addresses a particular concern. It could be a lightweight moisturizing lotion or a product for skin firmness.
- **Dry oil**: A favorite product of many women. It moisturizes the skin well, leaves no oily traces on clothes, absorbs quickly, and imparts a pleasant fragrance to the skin.
- **Lip balm**: If your beloved has dry lips, this product will be a real savior for her. The light, unobtrusive tint and pleasant scent of the balm will be an additional bonus to such a gift.
- **Scrub**: A versatile product for exfoliating the skin. It can be either very gentle or more intense. It's advisable to pay attention to the type of scrub the woman is used to using.
- **Lotion and balm**: Gentler daily care products. They effectively moisturize, heal small cracks, and nourish the skin.
- **Face cream**: It's best to ask the woman which cream she uses, as it's a very individual product. You can choose a universal nourishing cream for winter or a lighter moisturizing one for summer. Such cosmetics are never superfluous.
- **Face tonic**: A mandatory skincare product for different ages. It easily handles various tasks, whether it's adding extra radiance to the skin or providing a lifting effect.
- **Face mask**: No woman can do without this beauty product. Many masks work wonders with instant effects, moisturizing or mattifying the skin, while some have detox properties. To make sure you don't go wrong, give your beloved a trendy set of sheet masks for daily use or a jar of a top product based on her skin needs.
- **Eye patches**: Beauty industry marketers successfully promoted this product and made it trendy. But it also delivers results. Miracle patches can reduce puffiness under the eyes and give the skin a fresh, firm look.
